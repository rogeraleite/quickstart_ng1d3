  <p>The cycle plot is an established and effective visualization technique for patterns in periodic time series, like trends and seasonal cycles.   However, it is limited to univariate data. For multivariate time series, patterns that exist across several values are much harder or impossible to explore. We propose the multivariate cycle plot, a generalization of the original cycle plot, that reveals such patterns in multivariate time series. Our visualization is based on Mahalanobis distances to allow any number of dimensions. Utilizing the multivariate cycle plot in an interactive exploration environment, we extend the supported tasks to tackle the challenge of multivariate outlier detection. To enable interactive exploration and interpretation of outliers, we employ coordinated multiple views with a multivariate cycle plot next to univariate cycle plots of the underlying dimensions. With our approach it is possible to judge the outlyingness in context of the seasonal cycle in the multivariate time series.</p>
